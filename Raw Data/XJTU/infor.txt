Overview: The XJTU-SY dataset is a high-quality resource for fault prognostics, containing complete run-to-failure data from 15 rolling element bearings under accelerated degradation.
Experimental Setup: Bearings were run under stressful conditions until natural failure, capturing the entire degradation trajectory.
Data Characteristics: Contains horizontal and vertical vibration signals sampled at 25.6 kHz, recorded in 1.28-second snapshots at one-minute intervals.
Operating Conditions: Experiments were conducted under three different working conditions, varying in rotational speed and radial load (e.g., 2100 RPM/12 kN, 2250 RPM/11 kN).

XJTU-SY bearing datasets 
were provided by the Institute of Design Science and Basic Component at Xi’an Jiaotong University and the Changxing Sumyoung Technology Co. [88,89]. 
XJTU-SY datasets consisted of fifteen bearings run-to-failure data under three different working conditions.
 The dataset was collected at 2.56 kHz. A total of 32 768 data points were recorded, and the sampling period was equal to one minute.
  The details of bearing lifetime and fault elements were shown in Table 5.
   In this paper, we used all the data described in Table 6 and the total number of classes was fifteen.
    It should be noticed that we used collected data at the end of run-to-failure experiments.
