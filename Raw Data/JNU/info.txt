Overview: A modern resource featuring artificially induced faults, designed to provide clean data for developing classification algorithms under different speed domains.
Experimental Setup: Data was collected from a test rig using a single accelerometer. Faults were simulated by creating tiny dents on bearing components via wire-cutting.
Data Characteristics: Contains vibration signals sampled at 50 kHz, provided in .csv format.
Operating Conditions: Experiments were conducted under three distinct rotational speeds: 600, 800, and 1000 RPM.




Jiangnan University (JNU) 
bearing datasets were provided by Jiangnan University [92,93].
 JNU datasets consisted of three bearing vibration datasets with different rotating speeds,
  and the data were collected at 50 kHz. As shown in Table 7,
   JNU datasets contained one health state and three fault modes which include inner ring fault, 
   outer ring fault, and rolling element fault. 
   Therefore, the total number of classes was equal to twelve according to different working conditions.
