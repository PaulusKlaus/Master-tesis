Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) datasets were provided by the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center [83].
 Vibration signals were collected at 12 kHz or 48 kHz for normal bearings and damaged bearings
  with single-point defects under four different motor loads. Within each working condition, 
  single-point faults were introduced with fault diameters of 0.007, 0.014, and 0.021 inches on the rolling element, 
  the inner ring, and the outer ring, respectively. In this paper, we used the data collected from the drive end,
   and the sampling frequency was equivalent to 12 kHz. In Table 1, one healthy bearing and three fault modes, 
   including the inner ring fault, the rolling element fault, and the outer ring fault, 
were classified into ten categories (one health state and 9 fault states) according to different fault sizes.



For this experiment only the smallest faults were taken and their corresponding different motor loads. This correspondst to the 4 data groups:
-normal data (0, 1, 2, 3) HP
-inner race fault (0, 1, 2, 3) HP
- Ball dault (0, 1, 2, 3) HP
- outer race fault (0, 1, 2, 3) HP
