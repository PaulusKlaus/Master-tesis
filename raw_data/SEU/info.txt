Southeast University (SEU)

 gearbox datasets were provided by Southeast University [90,91].
 SEU datasets contained two subdatasets, including a bearing dataset and a gear dataset, 
 which were both acquired on drivetrain dynamic simulator (DDS). There were two kinds of working conditions 
 with rotating speed-load  configuration (RS-LC) set to be 20 Hz - 0 V and 30 Hz - 2 V shown in Table 6. 
 The total number of classes was equal to twenty according to Table 6 under different working conditions. 
Within each file, there were eight rows of vibration signals, and we used the second row of vibration signals.


Overview: A comprehensive resource collected from a Drivetrain Dynamics Simulator (DDS), including data for both bearings and gears to allow for the study of complex mechanical systems.
Experimental Setup: The data was acquired from the DDS test rig and is divided into sub-datasets for bearing and gear faults.
Data Characteristics: Contains multivariate time-series data with 8 channels, including vibration from multiple components and motor torque. Vibration was sampled at 12 kHz.
Operating Conditions: Data was collected under two speed-load configurations: 20 Hz-0V and 30 Hz-2V.
